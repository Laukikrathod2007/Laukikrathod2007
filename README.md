Hey there! 👋 I'm Laukik Rathod

🎯 Who am I?
Just a first-year IT student who gets unreasonably excited when code works on the first try (rare, but magical!). Currently deep in web development and spending way too many hours debugging things that worked yesterday.
What gets me going? Taking messy problems and turning them into clean, working solutions. That moment when everything clicks? Pure magic. ✨
🔥 Right now, I'm:

🌐 Building full-stack applications with MERN stack
🧠 Grinding DSA problems (leetcode nightmares are real)
🤖 Exploring Machine Learning and Data Science
📚 Learning MongoDB and backend architecture
☕ Converting coffee into code at alarming rates

Random fact: I actually enjoy debugging. Yeah, I'm that weird. Being a code detective is oddly satisfying! 🕵️‍♂️

🛠️ The Tools I Work With
Not gonna lie, this list keeps growing...

💭 Wisdom from the Coding Gods

"Code. Build. Learn. Repeat."
And occasionally question all life choices when debugging CSS 🙃
